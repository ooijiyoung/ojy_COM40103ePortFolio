<span class="blogTitle">Summary Of Week 4</span><br><span class="blogDate">Thursday, 25 August 2016</span>
<p>
I went to the class as usual to attend the lecturer class.<br><br>

This week topic for lecturer class is about "Culture and Social Studies". 
Basically, I learnt what is culture. In short, culture is a community which shared the same values, traditions, 
and beliefs. Also, how does our culture influence others or by others (due to globalisation).<br><br>

Culture clash is also in the topic we discussed in class. For example, UK (British) and US (American/Freedom-land) 
English. Which both use slightly different words or pronunciation for the same things, Cab vs Taxi, 
Cell Phone vs Mobile Phone, Soccer vs Football, ax vs axe, fries vs chips, chips vs crips, and some pronunciations 
such as route ("rowt" and "root") and flour ( "fl-or" vs "flower")<br><br>

I also learnt culture is not permanent as culture can be changed, transcend or invent. For example, Baba Nyonya 
culture in Malaysia is a mix of Malay and Chinese culture which makes this a very unique culture. In the present era 
of globalization, we exposed to "multiculturalism", even myself. First of all, what is multiculturalism, 
multiculturalism is the co-existence of diverse cultures, where culture includes racial, religious, or cultural groups and 
is manifested in customary behaviours, cultural assumptions and values, patterns of thinking, and communicative styles. 
In other words, multiculturalism is a society which have many culture lives together or a person have a small part in multiple culture. 
For example, a Malaysian-Chinese likes Burger (which is a Western Culture), prefer K-Pop (which is a korean culture)  attends an Caucasian University.<br><br> 

Today, we were given task to create a Storyboard for ideas based on our Self-Expression video ideas. 
This exercise is kind of confusing in the beginning, because some of us are wondering what if the video 
is not exactly same with the storyboard or something.... But in the end, we all managed to understand 
what is the purpose to create a storyboard and the storyboard is just use to plan the outline of the video.<br><br>

I will upload my storyboard and video soon once I done. (Stay tuned.)

<span class="blogTitle">Week 3 - SWOT</span><br><span class="blogDate">Thursday, 18 August 2016</span>
<p>
Today, my lecturer wanted all of us to create a SWOT Analysis of ourself
<br><br>
What is SWOT Analysis
"SWOT Analysis is  is an acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. SWOT analysis can also used in decision making."
<br><br>
We will be using popplet to create the SWOT analysis, and we're going to use this SWOT analysis as a "guideline" for another individual assignment
